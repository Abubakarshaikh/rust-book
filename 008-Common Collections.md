# Common Collections
* Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called collections.
* Most other data types represent one specific value, but collections can contain multiple values.
* Unlike the built-in array and tuple types.
* the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the
program runs.
* 

## Storing Lists of Values with ``Vectors``
* The first collection type we’ll look at is ``Vec<T>``, also known as a vector. 
* Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory.
* Vectors can only store values of the same type.
* They are useful when you have a list of items, such as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping cart.
